## ScoreBox ##
..*We created a custom way to emit events. This documentation after the fact on the implementation of ScoreBox and the subtools needed to get it working properly.


## Align Grid ##
..*This tool is needed because a very common problem is that with different devices, we don't know the game size and this can become problematic when laying out game components/objects.
..*Layout in a grid can help us 'bootstrap this'.

..*To make the code display be responsive, we made use of "navigator.userAgent" check within main.js, and based on the response from the check, we would load a different 'config' for the game. More documentaion can be found at:

## Text Button ##
..Quick and easy way to make buttons for our games. Button outline images and we just overlay text onto them

## Media-Manager ##
..Created a mediaManager util that responds to the emitter constants of PLAY_SOUND, and MUSIC_CHANGED. 
..Also, in SceneMain, the buttons toggle whether or not the player wants sound working. (This is handled on the SceneMain emitter response function)
    ..*Added a specific ToggleButton.js for this within 'ui/'
